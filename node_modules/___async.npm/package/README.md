# Async.js

Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions
for working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for
use with [node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the
browser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).

Async provides around 20 functions that include the usual 'functional'
suspects (map, reduce, filter, each…) as well as some common patterns
for asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these
functions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single
callback as the last argument of your async function.


## Quick Examples

```javascript
async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results){
    // results is now an array of stats for each file
});

async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.exists, function(results){
    // results now equals an array of the existing files
});

async.parallel([
    function(){ ... },
    function(){ ... }
], callback);

async.series([
    function(){ ... },
    function(){ ... }
]);
```

There are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a
full list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is
missing please create a GitHub issue for it.

## Common Pitfalls

### Binding a context to an iterator

This section is really about bind, not about async. If you are wondering how to
make async execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why
a method of another library isn't working as an iterator, study this example:

```js
// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method
var AsyncSquaringLibrary = {
  squareExponent: 2,
  square: function(number, callback){ 
    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);
    setTimeout(function(){
      callback(null, result);
    }, 200);
  }
};

async.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){
  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]
  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square
  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is
  // therefore undefined.
});

async.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){
  // result is [1, 4, 9]
  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before
  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its 
  // 'home' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`
  // will be as expected.
});
```

## Collections

<a name="forEach" />
<a name="each" />
### each(arr, iterator, callback)

Applies an iterator function to each item in an array, in parallel.
The iterator is called with an item from the list and a callback for when it
has finished. If the iterator passes an error to this callback, the main
callback for the each function is immediately called with the error.

Note, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel
there is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has 
  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without 
  arguments or with an explicit null argument.
* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions
  have finished, or an error has occurred.

__Example__

```js
// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function
// to save the modified contents of that file:

async.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){
    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="forEachSeries" />
<a name="eachSeries" />
### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)

The same as each only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in
series. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed
processing. This means the iterator functions will complete in order.


---------------------------------------

<a name="forEachLimit" />
<a name="eachLimit" />
### eachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)

The same as each only no more than "limit" iterators will be simultaneously 
running at any time.

Note that the items are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that
 the first "limit" iterator functions will complete before any others are 
started.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* limit - The maximum number of iterators to run at any time.
* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(err) which must be called once it has 
  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without 
  arguments or with an explicit null argument.
* callback(err) - A callback which is called after all the iterator functions
  have finished, or an error has occurred.

__Example__

```js
// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a
// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.

async.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){
    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="map" />
### map(arr, iterator, callback)

Produces a new array of values by mapping each value in the given array through
the iterator function. The iterator is called with an item from the array and a
callback for when it has finished processing. The callback takes 2 arguments, 
an error and the transformed item from the array. If the iterator passes an
error to this callback, the main callback for the map function is immediately
called with the error.

Note, that since this function applies the iterator to each item in parallel
there is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order, however
the results array will be in the same order as the original array.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once 
  it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.
* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator
  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the
  transformed items from the original array.

__Example__

```js
async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results){
    // results is now an array of stats for each file
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="mapSeries" />
### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)

The same as map only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in
series. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed
processing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.


---------------------------------------

<a name="mapLimit" />
### mapLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)

The same as map only no more than "limit" iterators will be simultaneously 
running at any time.

Note that the items are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that
 the first "limit" iterator functions will complete before any others are 
started.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* limit - The maximum number of iterators to run at any time.
* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(err, transformed) which must be called once 
  it has completed with an error (which can be null) and a transformed item.
* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator
  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array of the
  transformed items from the original array.

__Example__

```js
async.map(['file1','file2','file3'], 1, fs.stat, function(err, results){
    // results is now an array of stats for each file
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="filter" />
### filter(arr, iterator, callback)

__Alias:__ select

Returns a new array of all the values which pass an async truth test.
_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or
false, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the
way node libraries work with truth tests like fs.exists. This operation is
performed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the
original.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be called with a 
  boolean argument once it has completed.
* callback(results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator
  functions have finished.

__Example__

```js
async.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.exists, function(results){
    // results now equals an array of the existing files
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="filterSeries" />
### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)

__alias:__ selectSeries

The same as filter only the iterator is applied to each item in the array in
series. The next iterator is only called once the current one has completed
processing. The results array will be in the same order as the original.

---------------------------------------

<a name="reject" />
### reject(arr, iterator, callback)

The opposite of filter. Removes values that pass an async truth test.

---------------------------------------

<a name="rejectSeries" />
### rejectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)

The same as reject, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array
in series.


---------------------------------------

<a name="reduce" />
### reduce(arr, memo, iterator, callback)

__aliases:__ inject, foldl

Reduces a list of values into a single value using an async iterator to return
each successive step. Memo is the initial state of the reduction. This
function only operates in series. For performance reasons, it may make sense to
split a call to this function into a parallel map, then use the normal
Array.prototype.reduce on the results. This function is for situations where
each step in the reduction needs to be async, if you can get the data before
reducing it then it's probably a good idea to do so.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* memo - The initial state of the reduction.
* iterator(memo, item, callback) - A function applied to each item in the
  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The iterator is passed a
  callback(err, reduction) which accepts an optional error as its first 
  argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is 
  passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main callback is 
  immediately called with the error.
* callback(err, result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator
  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.

__Example__

```js
async.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){
    // pointless async:
    process.nextTick(function(){
        callback(null, memo + item)
    });
}, function(err, result){
    // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="reduceRight" />
### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)

__Alias:__ foldr

Same as reduce, only operates on the items in the array in reverse order.


---------------------------------------

<a name="detect" />
### detect(arr, iterator, callback)

Returns the first value in a list that passes an async truth test. The
iterator is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return true will
fire the detect callback with that result. That means the result might not be
the first item in the original array (in terms of order) that passes the test.

If order within the original array is important then look at detectSeries.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be called with a 
  boolean argument once it has completed.
* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns
  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be
  the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iterator) or the
  value undefined if none passed.

__Example__

```js
async.detect(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.exists, function(result){
    // result now equals the first file in the list that exists
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="detectSeries" />
### detectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)

The same as detect, only the iterator is applied to each item in the array
in series. This means the result is always the first in the original array (in
terms of array order) that passes the truth test.


---------------------------------------

<a name="sortBy" />
### sortBy(arr, iterator, callback)

Sorts a list by the results of running each value through an async iterator.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(err, sortValue) which must be called once it
  has completed with an error (which can be null) and a value to use as the sort
  criteria.
* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator
  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is the items from
  the original array sorted by the values returned by the iterator calls.

__Example__

```js
async.sortBy(['file1','file2','file3'], function(file, callback){
    fs.stat(file, function(err, stats){
        callback(err, stats.mtime);
    });
}, function(err, results){
    // results is now the original array of files sorted by
    // modified date
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="some" />
### some(arr, iterator, callback)

__Alias:__ any

Returns true if at least one element in the array satisfies an async test.
_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or
false, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the
way node libraries work with truth tests like fs.exists. Once any iterator
call returns true, the main callback is immediately called.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be called with a 
  boolean argument once it has completed.
* callback(result) - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns
  true, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be
  either true or false depending on the values of the async tests.

__Example__

```js
async.some(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.exists, function(result){
    // if result is true then at least one of the files exists
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="every" />
### every(arr, iterator, callback)

__Alias:__ all

Returns true if every element in the array satisfies an async test.
_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of true or
false, it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the
way node libraries work with truth tests like fs.exists.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over.
* iterator(item, callback) - A truth test to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be called with a 
  boolean argument once it has completed.
* callback(result) - A callback which is called after all the iterator
  functions have finished. Result will be either true or false depending on
  the values of the async tests.

__Example__

```js
async.every(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.exists, function(result){
    // if result is true then every file exists
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="concat" />
### concat(arr, iterator, callback)

Applies an iterator to each item in a list, concatenating the results. Returns the
concatenated list. The iterators are called in parallel, and the results are
concatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will
be returned in the original order of the arguments passed to the iterator function.

__Arguments__

* arr - An array to iterate over
* iterator(item, callback) - A function to apply to each item in the array.
  The iterator is passed a callback(err, results) which must be called once it 
  has completed with an error (which can be null) and an array of results.
* callback(err, results) - A callback which is called after all the iterator
  functions have finished, or an error has occurred. Results is an array containing
  the concatenated results of the iterator function.

__Example__

```js
async.concat(['dir1','dir2','dir3'], fs.readdir, function(err, files){
    // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories
});
```

---------------------------------------

<a name="concatSeries" />
### concatSeries(arr, iterator, callback)

Same as async.concat, but executes in series instead of parallel.


## Control Flow

<a name="series" />
### series(tasks, [callback])

Run an array of functions in series, each one running once the previous
function has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its
callback, no more functions are run and the callback for the series is
immediately called with the value of the error. Once the tasks have completed,
the results are passed to the final callback as an array.

It is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be
run as a function and the results will be passed to the final callback as an object
instead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from
async.series.


__Arguments__

* tasks - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed
  a callback(err, result) it must call on completion with an error (which can
  be null) and an optional result value.
* callback(err, results) - An optional callback to run once all the functions
  have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all 
  the result arguments passed to the task callbacks.

__Example__

```js
async.series([
    function(callback){
        // do some stuff ...
        callback(null, 'one');
    },
    function(callback){
        // do some more stuff ...
        callback(null, 'two');
    }
],
// optional callback
function(err, results){
    // results is now equal to ['one', 'two']
});


// an example using an object instead of an array
async.series({
    one: function(callback){
        setTimeout(function(){
            callback(null, 1);
        }, 200);
    },
    two: function(callback){
        setTimeout(function(){
            callback(null,
